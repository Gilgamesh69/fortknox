# Fort Knox Password Manager
Personally encrypt and store your passwords on your own computer.

* GUI inteface (MVC)
* uses randomly selected characters of an adjustable length
* encrypts master password and other saved passwords using an RSA key pair predefined in code (Change this if you actually plan on using this)
* tested with sending encrypted file to a defined email address so that this can be set up and updated on multiple computers.

Notes: the email functionality has some problems , I was able to get it working on one computer but seems to have a problem when testing on another
due to time constraints , I may not be able to fix this for a time. Feel free to send a pull request If you wish to contribute.
